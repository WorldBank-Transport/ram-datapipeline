# Calculate ETA

Calculates the time matrix between all origins and destinations in a given area.
Executed as a forked node process that responds to messages.

This file is not called directly because node does not support all the used es6 features.
The file `calculateETA.js` in the parent directory contains the babel register and should be executed instead.
